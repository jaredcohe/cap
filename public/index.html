      <p>Proprietor Joe Viscomi opened Cappy’s Warehouse Wine & Spirits in July 2006, after amassing 40 years experience in the retail wine & spirit business.  While still a teen, Joe began his career with future father-in-law Pete Capizzi at Henry Street Warehouse Liquors in Hempstead, NY.  In 1994 he established Wheatley Hills Discount Wine & Spirits in Westbury, NY, with sister-in-law, Roseann Kalb.  Each of these three family stores is independently owned and operated and is not part of a cooperative buying group.</p>
      <p>Joe is currently the Chairman of the Metropolitan Package Store Association, a retailer advocate group, and was recently honored to be chosen “Man of the Year” by the Long Island Wine & Liquor Salesman Association.</p>
      <p>Cappy’s maintains an extensive selection of domestic wines from the Pacific Coast to the east end of Long Island and imported wines from Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Greece (?), Chile, Argentina, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, including organic and kosher wines, along with a large selection of liquor, cordials and ready-to-drink cocktails, all at rock-bottom prices.  New arrivals are a constant.  Cappy’s knowledgeable and friendly management team is always willing to help you make your selection and will gladly special order any item that is not regularly stocked.</p>
